# Go's Discriminating JSON (gdj)

This repository contains a fork of Golang's [`encoding/json`](https://pkg.go.dev/encoding/json) package, enhanced with support for encoding type information into objects via a [discriminator](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8927#name-discriminator).

## License

This is a fork of Go's `encoding/json` package and so uses the same license as Golang.
